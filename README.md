## Getting Started

Effective medication management is crucial for ensuring adherence to prescribed treatments, which directly impacts patient health outcomes. However, traditional methods often fall short of supporting patients, particularly those with complex medication regimens. Nonadherence to a prescribed medication plan accounts for 50% of treatment failures, around 125,000 deaths, and up to 25% of hospitalizations each year in the United States.  Software development advancements and improved device accessibility have led to the development of medication management applications in an effort to combat this issue. Some integrate with physical pill caddy IoT devices to offer real-time tracking and reminders.
